# Ahmad Azari Data-Analyst-portfolio

# About

Hi, I'm Ahmad! I have a technical background and hold double major in chemical engineering and chemistry and a Masters in Energy Policy Analysis. I have worked for 3 years in engineering and data analytics roles as Energy Analyst and a Data Operations Associate as a solar software start up. I love finding the hidden value of data science, I have been mentoring 3 individuals break into data science at different levels in their career.

I had taken the time to complete several coursera courses in SQL and Python and I am using this repository to showcase my skills, share projects and track my progress.
